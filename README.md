# Linear Regression with Single Perceptron Neural Network

This repository contains Python code implementing a simple linear regression model using a single perceptron neural network. The code is organized into two main sections:

1. **Linear Regression with Single Perceptron and One Input Node**
2. **Linear Regression with Single Perceptron and Two Input Nodes**

## Linear Regression with Single Perceptron and One Input Node

In this section, a basic linear regression model is implemented using TensorFlow. The model consists of a single perceptron with one input node. The code demonstrates how to train the model using gradient descent and visualize the regression line.

### Key Components:

- **`compute_cost` Function**: Calculates the mean squared error cost function.
- **`gradient_descent` Function**: Performs gradient descent to update weights and bias.
- **`nn_model` Function**: Implements the training loop for the neural network model.
- **Visualization**: Plots the original data points and the regression line.

## Linear Regression with Single Perceptron and Two Input Nodes

In this section, a more complex linear regression model is implemented using TensorFlow. The model consists of a single perceptron with two input nodes. This allows for a more detailed analysis of the relationship between input features and the target variable.

### Key Components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization of input features and target variable.
- **Model Training**: Training of the neural network model using gradient descent.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot of original data points and regression line.
